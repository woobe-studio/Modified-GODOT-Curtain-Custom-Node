# Integrating the Curtain Node into Godot Editor

To seamlessly integrate the new Curtain node into your Godot editor, simply follow these straightforward steps:

### 1. Icon Placement
- Locate the icon file for the Curtain node in your project directory.
- Move the `.png` icon from the `src` folder to the designated directory: `\editor\icons`.

### 2. Add Source Files
- Copy the `.cpp` and `.h` files of the Curtain node from `src` folder to the `\scene\2d` directory within your project.

### 3. Update `registry_scene_types.cpp`
- Navigate to the `registry_scene_types.cpp` file located in the `\scene` directory of your project.
- Inside `registry_scene_types.cpp`, perform the following actions:
  
  - **Include the Node Header**:
    
    ```cpp
    #include "scene/2d/curtain.h"
    ```
  - **Register the Node after registering Node2D find it first ðŸ˜Ž**:
    
    ```cpp
    ClassDB::register_class<Curtain>();
    ```

Following these steps will seamlessly integrate the Curtain node into your Godot editor environment, enabling smooth usage and enhanced functionality.

That's it! You're now ready to utilize the TextLabel node within your Godot projects. Happy coding! ðŸš€
